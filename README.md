# erc725-proposal

This is a demonstration of how [ERC725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725) can be split into two separate standards, keeping a separation of concerns between identity and key management.

The tests demonstrate usage of these contracts. They can be run with `npm test` (after you have done an `npm install`).
